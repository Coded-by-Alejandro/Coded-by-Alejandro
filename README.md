# üóùÔ∏è  Coded By Alejandro
Hi, I‚Äôm **[Alejandro]**, an aspiring data scientist passionate about extracting insights from complex datasets and applying quantitative methods to solve real-world problems.  I‚Äôm currently in the final stages of my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the Facultad de Ciencias F√≠sico Matem√°ticas at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n.
Throughout my academic journey, I‚Äôve developed a solid foundation in advanced mathematical topics, including differential, integral, and vector calculus; linear algebra; group, ring, and field theory; general topology; and real analysis. Additionally, I have experience in programming and computational thinking, which I use to model, simulate, and analyze data-driven scenarios.
